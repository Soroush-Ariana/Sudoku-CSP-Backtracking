# Sudoku-CSP-Backtracking
This project implements a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm, tailored to tackle Sudoku as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The algorithm efficiently searches for solutions by exploring possibilities within constraints, ensuring an optimal solution to even the most challenging puzzles.
